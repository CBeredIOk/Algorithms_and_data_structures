Assignments from the book "Data Structures and Algorithms in JAVA" by R. Laforet

The book contains a large number of assignments covering specific topics in its chapters. Examples include the Josephus Flavius problem, the Tower of Hanoi, the satchel problem, implementing a cyclic list, stack, queue, and various search algorithms

I have posted my solutions to these tasks in this repository. However, the problems are currently organized exclusively by chapter, which can make it difficult to find a problem of interest in a particular chapter
